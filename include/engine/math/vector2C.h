$ 50 shades of const:

* const datatype* var:
    - The var pointer is strictly read only.
    - Values or members cannot be atlered.

* datatype* const var:
    - The var pointer is read and write.
    - The pointer var is locked and cannot be reassigned.

* returntype function(datatype& para) const:
    - This const at the end of the declaration gurrenttes the function will not change the members.
    - Due to this complier can optimise by keeping the members in the registers.
    - It reduces continous loading and unloading from RAM to registers.
